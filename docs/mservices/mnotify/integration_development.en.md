#Integration development

##**Get started**

###**System registration  and network access**

MNotify authenticates the client systems by client certificate serial number. MNotify clients must be registered in MNotify before being able to call the API.

MNotify API is accessible only to a registered set of IP addresses and, for security sensitive information systems, this means configuring a VPN and/or configuring routes between the consumer and MNotify.

To register your consumer and get network access, please write a request by e-mail to the Service owner, providing your public IP address or the VPN assigned private IP address and the certificate in your request.

!!! note "Obtaining credentials"
 
    MSign accepts client certificates generated by Certification Authority of the Center of Special Telecommunications ([https://pki.cts.md](https://pki.cts.md)), by requesting a certificate for authentication.

###**Obtaining technical contract**

The technical contract can be obtained from the following URLs into the table. Before you can open them, confirm that the system certificate has been installed in your browser. On starting the browser you will be asked to provide a certificate; please select the system certificate.
