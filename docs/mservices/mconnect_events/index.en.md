#Introduction

Data exchange in any Government is a complex endeavor across various levels of effort, including
legal, semantic, organizational and technical. In Moldova, the technical level of data exchange is
facilitated by MConnect – a national data exchange platform. There are many well-known patterns to
implement various data exchange scenarios, including classical request/response messaging,
events distribution, large documents distribution and data streaming.

As part of MConnect platform, MConnect Events is the component designed specifically for efficient
production and consumption of events. This includes client authentication and authorization as
producers and consumers, scalable production and consumption of events, event structure
validation when produced, scalable and flexible storage of events awaiting consumption, immediate
availability of events to consumers, confirmation of event consumption to ensure reliable delivery of
events, as well as internal instruments for configuration, monitoring and troubleshooting.

MConnect Events enables systems to exchange data about various events in real-time as well as in
a disconnected way. Events are flowing from producers to MConnect Events then to consumers in
their supported pace, whenever they are available. This lowers the coupling between producers and
consumers, decreasing their availability and performance requirements.

This document describes the technical interfaces exposed by MConnect Events for client
information systems enabling them to produce and consume events. Its target audience is the
development teams for those information systems.

The document contains the relevant information required for a complete understanding of MConnect
Events from the integration point of view. It contains integration-related technical details, security
considerations, as well as describing the integration testing.

Although the document is meant to be technology agnostic, it is also documenting the integration
library built for .NET to simplify and speed-up integrations with .NET clients.

##**Scope and target audience**

##**General system capabilities**

MConnect Events is a platform-level service, a component of MConnect, the National
Interoperability Platform, that allows information systems to efficiently produce and consume events
in near real-time.

Our performance tests showed a steady throughput of 10K events/second involving several
producers and consumers in parallel. You can produce and consume events from multiple instances
of your app using the same client certificate. Additionally, a consumer can repeatedly consume the
available events by specifying a different consumer group (instead of using the default one).

MConnect Events authorizes producers and routes events according to each event type. It is possible
to authorize multiple producers to produce events of the same event type and configure routing to
enable multiple consumers to consume events of the same type. Producer authorization also
includes validating each event structure using JSON schema defined for each event type.

Producers can produce a single event or a batch of events. It is important to mention that if one event
is wrong, e.g. having unauthorized event type for this producer or invalid structure according to the
configured schema, the whole batch is rejected.

In cases that require ordered consumption of events related to a particular real-life entity (such as a
person, transaction, etc.), producers must specify a partition key according to CloudEvents
partitioning extension.

By default, MConnect Events stores produced events for up to 5 days (120 hours) enabling
consumers to consume whenever they are available. To ensure high availability, events are stored in
3 replicas. These settings can be changed upon request when reasonable.

To simplify consumer integration testing, the API allows consumers to produce test events for their
own consumption.

Consumers can report back events they are unable to consume (usually due to wrong structure) as
dead events. They are stored in a special dead event storage for the consumer and might require
further manual intervention.

##**Service dependencies**
MConnect Events is deployed in a highly available infrastructure and depends only on the availability
of MPass API for client management. MPass API is also highly available, however, MConnect Events
caches client settings for up to 30 minutes. This ensures high performance of connection opening
except for the initial ones, thus decreasing this dependency.

It is also important to note that, due to implementation technicalities, it is normal for consumers to
start consuming events with a short delay (several seconds) after opening the consumer connection.

##**Protocols and standards**

MConnect Events exposes its APIs over HTTPS, supporting HTTP 1.1 and 2. The HTTPS endpoint uses
TLS 1.2 and higher and requires authentication through client certificates (encoded in X.509 v3
format).

MConnect Events clients use [CloudEvents v1](https://cloudevents.io) to produce and consume events using JSON Event
Format and HTTP Protocol Binding. Whenever required, producers can specify a partition key, as
documented in [CloudEvents partitioning extension](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/extensions/partitioning.md), while consumers shall use WebSocket Protocol Binding for efficient consumption of events.

The endpoints for producers and long-polling consumers are described in [OpenAPI 3.0](https://www.openapis.org/) format.
However, for efficient consumers, the recommendation is to use the WebSocket endpoint, which is
accessible via the standard [HTTP 1.1 Protocol upgrade mechanism](https://http.dev/protocol-upgrade), or the standard HTTP 2
CONNECT method ([see 8.3 in RFC 7540](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html)).

When validating events during production against the configured schema the supported versions of JSON Schema are Draft 6, Draft 7, Draft 2019-09 and [Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification). The version is identified based
on keywords used by the schema.

##**Limits**

According to CloudEvents standard, it is recommended that the published events be no larger than [**64 KB**](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md#size-limits). This not only ensures any intermediaries will forward the events but also makes the transmission of events efficient and allows broader distribution of events, while stressing the core meaning of events (i.e. messages that inform about something that happened and not a transport for any kind of data). CloudEvents producers SHOULD keep events compact by avoiding embedding large data items into event payloads and rather use the event payload to link to such data items.

All HTTP requests sent to MConnect Events can have up to **1 MB** in size. This means any HTTP message sent by the producer, an events batch or one single event, shall not be larger than 1 MB.

By default, MConnect Events keeps unconsumed events up to **5 days (120 hours)**. This means that if a consumer is inactive for that time, it might miss events.

By default, MConnect Events consumers in a group can be efficiently scaled in **divisors of 12**, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 12 consumers.

Should any of these limits not cover your practical scenarios, you can request their adjustments having a **proper justification**.
