#API Reference

##**Error handling rules**

MConnect Events REST APIs can return the following status codes in case of errors:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>HTTP Status Code</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>400 Bad Request</strong></td>
      <td>Returned when something is wrong with your request. For example, the request does not include the client certificate or an intermediary, some header is missing, the format is not a valid JSON, etc.
      <br>For more details, review the content of the response.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>401 Unauthorized</strong></td>
      <td>Returned on any authorization error. Either the system is not registered as producer or consumer, has wrong authorization configuration, does not have the rights to publish events of the provided event type, or cannot use the indicated source, etc.<br>For more details, review the content of the response.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>404 Not Found </strong></td>
      <td>The request URL wrong or consumer instance is not found (expired or not on the provided bridge).
      <br>For more details, review the content of the response.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>413 Content Too Large</strong></td>
      <td>Returned when the entire HTTP request is larger than specified in Limits.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>422 Unprocessable Entity</strong></td>
      <td>Returned when the event payload is not valid against the configured event schema.
      <br>For more details, review the content of the response.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong></td>
      <td>Unexpected error. Contact the service owner and report the error.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

!!! note "Succes HTTP status codes"

    On success, the returned status code is 200, 201, 202 or 204.

##**Producer APIs**

Producers can produce events using one of the following APIs.

<colspan class="red-bold-text">Important!</colspan> For production scenarios, is recommended to produce events in batches, using the last
endpoint. See also Limits.

###**Produce a batch of events (CloudEvents standard)**

<table>

      <td><strong>Endpoint</strong></td>
      <td colspan="3">POST /ce/produce/events</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
      <td colspan="3">Produce a batch of events according to CloudEvents standard, meaning the request body must be a valid JSON array of JSON objects. The standard <strong>HTTP Content-Type</strong> header must be set to <strong>application/cloudevents-batch+json</strong>.
      <br>
      <br>Each element of the array has the structure described in the previous endpoint.
      <br><strong>This is the recommended way to produce events</strong> if you implement the outbox pattern (which is also recommended), in which case you accumulate of list of events to be produced anyway.
      <br>
      <br>MConnect Events persists either all events to one or more destination consumers or none, in a transactional manner. This means that it is safe for a Producer to retry producing the batch of events on errors.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

##**Consumer APIs using WebSocket**

There are two protocols for event consumption. WebSocket is the recommended one for efficiency and performance reasons.

The WebSocket endpoint is accessible via the standard HTTP 1.1 Protocol upgrade mechanism and the standard HTTP 2 CONNECT method.

The WebSocket sub-protocol to be used is:
<br>**cloudevents.json**

The established WebSocket connection is a simultaneous two-way communication channel. The protocol is quite simple.

###**Messages sent to Consumer**

MConnect Events is streaming the events to be consumed to the client as separate messages in JSON format, looking like the following.


=== "Message_1"

    ```json
    {
      "specversion": "1.0",
      "source": "urn:source",
      "id": "sample-id-1001",
      "type": "Organization.Event.Occurred",
      "time": "2025...",
      "offset": "1",
      "data": { json-object-defined-as-current-type }
    }
    ```

=== "Message_2"

    ```json
    {
      "specversion": "1.0",
      "source": "urn:source",
      "id": "sample-id-1002",
      "type": "Organization.Event.Occurred",
      "time": "2025...",
      "offset": "2",
      "data": { json-object-defined-as-current-type }
    }
    ```
=== "Message_N"

    ```json
    {
      "specversion": "1.0",
      "source": "urn:source",
      "id": "sample-id-N",
      "type": "Organization.Event.Occurred",
      "time": "2025...",
      "offset": "N",
      "data": { json-object-defined-as-current-type }
    }
    ```
The meaning of the properties is the following:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Property</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Type</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>specversion</td>
      <td>string*</td>
      <td>The version of the CloudEvents specification which the event uses, currently always returned as ”1.0”.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>source</td>
      <td>uri*</td>
      <td>Identifies the context in which an event happened.
      <br>Producers MUST ensure that source + id is unique for each distinct event.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>id</td>
      <td>string*</td>
      <td>Identifies the event.
      <br>Producers MUST ensure that source + id is unique for each distinct event.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>type</td>
      <td>string*</td>
      <td>Contains a value describing the type of event related to the originating occurrence.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>subject</td>
      <td>string</td>
      <td>This describes the subject of the event in the context of the event producer (identified by source). A consumer will typically consume events emitted by a source, but the source identifier alone might not be sufficient as a qualifier for any specific event if the source context has an internal sub-structure. Optional.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>time</td>
      <td>date-time*</td>
      <td>Timestamp of when the event happened or when the event was produced. Formatted according to RFC 3339.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>partitionkey</td>
      <td>string</td>
      <td>A partition key for the event, specified to ensure consumption ordering between multiple events for the same partitionkey. Optional.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>offset</td>
      <td>string*</td>
      <td>Event offset for current consumer instance. Used for explicit confirmations.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>data</td>
      <td>JSON*</td>
      <td>The payload of the event in JSON format.</td>
    </tr>
    
    
  </tbody>
</table>

###**Messages sent to MConnect Events**

The client streams back consumption confirmations or dead events.
=== "consumption confirmation"
    ```txt
    confirm:<<offset>>
    ```
=== "report dead event"
    ```json
    {
        "specversion": "1.0",
        "source": "urn:source",
        "id": "sample-id-1002",
        "type": "Organization.Event.Occurred",
        "time": "2025...",
        "offset": "2",
        "data": { json-object-defined-as-current-type }
    }
    ```


  * **consumption confirmation** - meaning “confirm:” prefix followed by offset, where offset is string (an always increasing integer formatted as string) found from the incoming event. This results in all events up to the specified offset acknowledged as consumed.
  * **report dead event** - meaning “dead:” prefix followed by the dead event JSON, which the consumer might modify if required for later special handling of dead events.

Any other message prefix will result in MConnect Events closing the WebSocket connection.

##**Consumer APIs using long polling**

There are two protocols for event consumption. WebSocket is the recommended one. However, if you use a framework that doesn’t include a WebSocket client (which is highly doubtful) or if you just want to try event consumption using Swagger UI (or some local HTTP client tool), MConnect Events also implements the well-known long polling protocol.

Long polling requires creating a consumer, polling for events to consume (including sending consumption confirmations) and deleting consumers before closing. Consumers that are not actively polling for events are deleted automatically after some expiration time.

###**Creates a stateful consumer instance**

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Endpoint</strong></td>
      <td colspan="3">POST /ce/consumers</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
      <td colspan="3"> Creates a stateful consumer instance on one of the bridges that can be used to consume events in a long polling manner. It is normal for this endpoint to take some time (usually up to 30 seconds), as creating consumers requires some internal coordination.</td>

      <br>having the following path parameters:
      <br><i>bridge</i> – the instance of the bridge that the consumer was created on;
      <br><i>group</i> – the name of group for the created consumer;
      <br><i>instance</i> – consumer instance identifier.
      <br>
