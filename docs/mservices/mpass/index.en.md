#Introduction

MPass is a reusable governmental shared platform-level service the main scope of which is to offer secure authentication using a variety of authentication methods and provide information for further authorization decisions by the integrating systems. MPass enables a secure government-wide single sign-on (SSO) as well as single logout (SLO) for residents of Republic of Moldova, so that they don’t have to remember multiple credentials for different services and not requiring them to visit or register in some other way directly with the service provider.

This document describes the technical interfaces exposed by MPass for information systems that will use MPass as authentication and authorization information provider. Its target audience is the development teams for those information systems.

The document contains the relevant information required for a complete understanding of MPass from the integration point of view. It contains integration-related technical details, security considerations, as well as describing the process of testing integration security.

This document is also accompanied by a .NET sample that exemplify the main interaction scenarios, i.e. performing SSO and SLO.

##**Scope and target audience**

This document describes the technical interfaces exposed by MPass for information systems that will use MPass as authentication and authorization information provider. Its target audience is the development teams for those information systems.

The details related to various authentication methods, such as using authorized client certificates, mobile signature, username/password, etc. provided by MPass are out of scope of this document.

##**Notations**
This document contains several notation styles; the following details the styles that have a degree of significance beyond the purpose of communicating information:
<br><span class="highlight-text-yellow">Yellow Highlighted Text</span> – Text that is highlighted in yellow irrespective of font attributes (font type, italics, bold, underlined, etc.) means that the text is waiting clarification or verification.
<br><span class="red-bold-text">Red Bold Text</span> – Text that is red in color and bold, defines an important piece of information that must be read.
<br>***Italic Bold Text*** – Text that is bold and italic detail actual information or scripts that need to be executed, created, and copied from or to.
<br>~~Strikethrough Text~~ – Text which is outdated and should be ignored

##**General system capabilities**

MPass is a reusable governmental shared platform-level service the main scope of which is to offer secure authentication using a variety of authentication methods and provide information for further authorization decisions by the integrating systems. MPass enables a secure government-wide single sign-on (SSO) as well as single logout (SLO) for residents of Republic of Moldova, so that they don’t have to remember multiple credentials for different services and not requiring them to visit or register in some other way directly with the service provider.

MPass is used as intermediary between various information systems and various authentication methods. Authentication methods differ significantly from the integration point of view, exposing various APIs that might involve direct user interaction through the browser to enter some additional data and/or access user’s cryptographic device or interact with cryptographic devices that are not directly connected to user’s PC. MPass integrates with these identity and authentication providers, hides the differences and exposes a single unified and secure interface to information systems that require authentication functionality.

Depending on requesting information system, MPass will provide various attributes about the authenticated user identity. These attributes might come from user certificate used for authentication, user’s profile in MPass or external authentic systems. Using the provided identity attribute values, integrating systems can further perform authorization decisions inside their session established for the authenticated identity.

For actual authentication, MPass exposes web pages that guide the user through authentication method, method specific data input, authentication progress and result pages.

##**Service dependencies**
MPass depends on the digital identity providers, so its availability and performance is directly influenced by the availability and performance of the services delivered by the providers.

##**Protocols and standards**

MPass is using SAML v2.0 standard protocol and format for authentications. The following table contains a comprehensive list of references to standard specifications.
